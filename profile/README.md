This GitHub organization exists to revive [HDMI2USB](https://github.com/timvideos/HDMI2USB) by [timvideos](https://code.timvideos.us/home/).
More specifically, it exists to revive HDMI2USB's [litex firmware](https://github.com/timvideos/HDMI2USB-litex-firmware).

HDMI2USB has not been developed since 2020. As of 2024, the firmware no longer builds correctly out of the box. My goal is to fix that.

That said, I don't intend to maintain this project. I have a temporary need for HDMI2USB, and once that need is met I expect to stop working on this.
I'm publishing my work in public in case it is helpful to anyone else also wanting to revive HDMI2USB.
